> this is some replicated work in  Yucebio. Here I write some scripts for basic statstics.
------
Maybe it looks so boring but I learn to write my fisrt python code for text processing and do basic analysis on them.

## list
classcode.py counts class code in assembled transcription in stringtie for compare the distribution of those code in differen samples,
which help us to distiguish those outlying sample.

correlation count the correlation: I am so sorry that I forget what is used to do.

count_simulation: to compare diverse alignment soft, I applyed simulated RNA-seq reads as input and roughly calculates those sensitivity and precision.

myToolAssembly: I integrid some of replicate analysis in here based on threading programming.
`tools listed above are moved and assembled into gtfstats`
edgeR: just a script, you need make some changes before you use it.
purity-estimate: based on RNA-seq data for estimate the purity of tumor
